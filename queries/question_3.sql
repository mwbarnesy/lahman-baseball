-- PART ONE: Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University.

-- Create a CTE that SELECTS schoolid and schoolname WHERE schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'.
-- Create a CTE that returns the playerid, and the total monies earned from the salaries table.
WITH 
vandy AS
	(
	SELECT 
		schoolid,
		schoolname
	FROM schools
	WHERE schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'
	) -- End of vandy CTE
,
salary AS 
	(
	SELECT 
		playerid, -- This column was only included to test the salary CTE.
		SUM(salary) AS total_monies
	FROM salaries
	GROUP BY playerid -- Must GROUP BY a non aggregated column.
	-- ORDER BY total_monies DESC -- This allows me to see the highest earner at a glance.
	-- The previous two lines were commented out because I wanted to test the query to make sure it worked. 
	) -- End of salary CTE
-- End of WITH clause

-- In the outer query, select the schoolname from vandy, and playerid from collegeplaying.
SELECT vandy.schoolname, c.playerid, p.namefirst, p.namelast
FROM vandy
-- Create an INNER JOIN to join vandy and collegeplaying ON schoolid
INNER JOIN collegeplaying AS c
ON vandy.schoolid = c.schoolid
INNER JOIN people AS p
ON p.playerid = c.playerid
