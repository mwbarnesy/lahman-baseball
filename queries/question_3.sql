    QUESTION ::
        Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. 
		Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total 
		salary they earned in the major leagues. Sort this list in descending order by 
		the total salary earned. Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

    SOURCES ::
        * people, collegeplaying, schools, salaries

    DIMENSIONS ::
        * people = playerid, namefirst, namelast 
		* collegeplaying = playerid, schoolid 
		* schools = schoolid, schoolname
		* salaries = playerid, salary

    FACTS ::
        SUM(salary) to get the total salary. 

    FILTERS ::
        WHERE schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'.

    DESCRIPTION ::
        After many attempts to write a CTE to help solve the problem, I decided to rely solely on JOINS.
		I could make each query of the CTE work independently, but not together. Once I realized I could 
		get the results I wanted using INNER JOINS, it came down to figuring out where the WHERE filter 
		would be happy. 

    ANSWER ::
        David Price made $245,553,888 in the majors.
